## PDF CV

### Intent ###

In an attempt to be more creative, I thought I'd create my PDF CV by using a front-end tech stack. I also utilised Adobe Animate 
to construct different vectors and formulate a calm-looking background. The shape of the separate columns are hopefully suggestive of iPhone Apps, an area I'd one day like to go into! Please visit
the site below if you are interested!

### Deployment ###
